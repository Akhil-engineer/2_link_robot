# ðŸ¦¾ 2-Link Robotic Arm Drawing System

This project uses a 2-link robotic arm to draw images and shapes using inverse kinematics. A Python script calculates joint angles and sends them to an Arduino that controls two servos.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Upload the Arduino code to your board.
2. Connect the servos.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python draw_image.py
